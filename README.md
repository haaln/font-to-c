### font2c

font2c is a small Python script that generates C code for TrueType, OpenType and other fonts supported by FreeType. The code can be compiled directly and linked into C programs to enable them to draw text without any external libraries. Example C code for using the generated code to draw text is also included. This is mainly intended for use in embedded systems.

There are many of these generators around, but I didn't find one that met my three requirements:

- Run on Linux
- Draw antialiased fonts
- Preserve and use advance data to allow slanted characters to overlap (it's not complete kerning but helps a lot)

#### Usage

Prepare dependencies

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
    $ sudo pip install freetype-py
    
Get the path to a TTF font. If you don't know where they are, try:

    $ locate --regex "\.ttf$" | less

In `font2c.py`:

- Set `FONT_FILE_PATH` to the path found earlier.
- Set `FONT_PIXEL_SIZE` to the size of the font, in pixels (seems to be approximate)
- If the complete range of characters from ASCII 32 to 127 is not required, edit FIRST_CHAR and LAST_CHAR.

Run `font2c.py`:

    $ ./font2c.py
    
#### Example output

Two files will be generated. For instance:

    century_schoolbook_l_bold_30_font.h
    century_schoolbook_l_bold_30_font.c

A table of pixel values for each character in the range set by FIRST_CHAR and LAST_CHAR is generated. An
example for the character "*" in 30 pixels for the font Century Schoolbook L Bold:

    // * (42)
    0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x85,0xf1,0x52,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00, //      +@-

    0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0xcc,0xff,0x8c,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00, //      #@+

Another table of offsets into this table and other font medata is also generated.

These tables can then be used to draw text by looking up the characters and copying them to the display.
